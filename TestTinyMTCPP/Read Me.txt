This folder contains the program used to test the C++ version of TinyMT.  The name of this project is TestTinyMTCPP and is a win32 native project.  One of the tests involves verifying that the same random number sequence that is generated with the C++ version is exactly the same as the original C version.  So, the original C files are also in this folder.  They have been modified slightly in order for the project to build correctly under VC++.

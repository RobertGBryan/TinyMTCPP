This folder contains the C++ version of the TinyMT32 and TinyMT64 random number generator classes.  TinyMT is a version of the Mersenne Twister random number generator, but uses a much smaller state.  It has a period of 2^127 - 1.  This is a port of the original TinyMT C code by Mutsuo Saito (Hiroshima University) and Makoto Matsumoto (The University of Tokyo).  The original C files can be found in the TinyMT-src-1.0.1 Orig C Code folder.  More recent files might also be available from the TinyMT project on github.

The original C codes implements 2 additional projects that have not (as of this date) been ported.  One is called TinyMTDC, which is used to set the 3 values (Mat1, Mat2, and TMat) which are used to initialize the TinyMT rng.  Data files containing hundredes of thousands of values for these parameters are included in the folder DC Data.  Only values generated from this program should be used to initialize these values.  The other project is called TinyMTJump.  This project provides the capability to quickly jump to the next random number that is N away.  For example, if N is 1 million, it would return the next random number that is 1 million away from the last one.  It does not do this by calling the TinyMT rng 1 million times.  Instead, it uses a mathematical formula that is much quicker.  Most rngs do not offer this capability, but then again most users will find no need for this functionality.
